    r"""Return a projector over a collection of basis states.

    This function constructs a diagonal operator that projects onto the
    states from the basis in which this MPO is represented. It takes as
    first argument a list of `IndexSelector`, a sequence of integers
    representing specific basis states, or `ALL_STATES`, allowing any
    state along that direction.

    Arguments
    ---------
    selectors : list[IndexSelector]
        A list of `list[int]` where the magic value `ALL_STATES`
        indicates that all basis states for the specific component
        are allowed.
    dimensions : list[int]
        List of physical dimensions of the MPO
    strategy : Strategy, default = `DEFAULT_STRATEGY`
        Truncation strategy when applying this MPO.

    Returns
    -------
    projector : MPO
        The diagonal operator in matrix product form, unsimplified.

    Examples
    --------
    Projector onto the :math:`|0,0,0\rangle` state.
    >>> P000 = basis_states_projector_mpo([0,0,0], [2,2,2])
    Composite operator :math:`I\otimes|0\rangle\langle0|\otimes I` state.
    >>> P000 = basis_states_projector_mpo([ALL_STATES,0,ALL_STATES], [2,2,2])
