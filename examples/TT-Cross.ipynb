    "## Loading black-box functions with TT-Cross\n",
    "\n",
    "TT-Cross, also known as tensor cross-interpolation (TCI), is a method to load black-box functions in tensor trains or MPS. This library implements several variants of TT-Cross, each with its strengths and weaknesses. In this example, we show the usage of the DMRG-based variant `cross_DMRG`, which is specially suitable for MPS with small physical dimension. However, these examples apply analogously to all other variants by just replacing the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The black-box function given as input corresponds to a `BlackBox` object. There are several subclasses corresponding to different input black-boxes, applicable in different scenarios. In this notebook, we show a brief example for each type."
