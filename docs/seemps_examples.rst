In the directory `examples` of the library, we have created various Jupyter notebooks that solve canonical problems using the SeeMPS library tools, from computing ground states of many-body problems, to solving static and time-dependent partial differential equations.

- `Computation of a spin-1/2 model ground state using DMRG <https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/seemps2/blob/main/examples/DMRG.ipynb>`_.
- `Solution of a Hamiltonian PDE <https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/seemps2/blob/main/examples/PDE.ipynb>`_.

Further examples of use appear in the datasets and associated codes to the following publications:
