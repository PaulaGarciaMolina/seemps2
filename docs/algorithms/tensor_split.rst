Tensor splitting
****************

One of the most basic algorithms for tensor network manipulation is to
approximate a tensor with multiple legs, by a contraction of tensors with
smaller numbers of legs. There are various criteria to do this, but in this
section we will discuss thosed based on the Schmidt decomposition.
