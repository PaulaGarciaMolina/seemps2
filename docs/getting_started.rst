Getting started
***************

The SeeMPS project is available from at `GitHub <https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/seemps2>`_.
You can clone it using git from the command line::

  git clone https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/seemps2.git

This will create a copy of the repository with all the notebook files and the
processed Python library.

The project can be installed directly from a cloned folder::

  pip install seemps2

Or it can also be installed directly from the internet::

  pip install git+https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/seemps2.git

This will install the required dependencies, compile the library and install it
in your current python environment.
